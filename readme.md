###3. LESS Structure  

Folder structure will usually be set to:


    -- base  
    -- components  
    -- regions  
    -- pages  
    -- utilities  


blocks style should go to the **components** or **regions** folder it depends on the design, but if necessary you can add a **blocks** folder and add all the individual blocks style there.
Same thing goes for **views**, their style is usually in the **pages** folder.
